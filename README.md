/ Was there a time when dancers with      \
| their fiddles In children's circuses    |
| could stay their troubles? There was a  |
| time they could cry over books, But     |
| time has set its maggot on their track. |
| Under the arc of the sky they are       |
| unsafe. What's never known is safest in |
| this life. Under the skysigns they who  |
| have no arms Have cleanest hands, and,  |
| as the heartless ghost Alone's unhurt,  |
| so the blind man sees best.             |
|                                         |
